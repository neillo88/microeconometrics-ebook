# Difference-in-Differences - Part 1

Recall Lecture 1.2 *Causal Inference*,

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## (Imbens and Rubin, 2015, p. 6)

1.  "First, the definition of the causal effect depends on the potential outcomes, but it does not depend on which outcome is actually observed."
2.  "Second, the causal effect is the comparison of potential outcomes, for the same unit, at the same moment in time post-treatment. In particular, **the causal effect is not defined in terms of comparisons of outcomes at different times.**[^paralleltrends-1]"
:::

[^paralleltrends-1]: Emphasis added.

## Set-up: 2-group-2-period

The simple 2-group-2-period difference-in-differences set-up has the following characteristics,

-   Two periods of data: either panel (longitudinal) or repeated cross-section
-   A control group that is never-treated[^paralleltrends-2]
-   Treatment is absorbing: 'always-on'[^paralleltrends-3]
-   Typically, the treatment takes place in the second period.

[^paralleltrends-2]: If you use an always-treated control group you would need to assume static treatment effects.

[^paralleltrends-3]: More relevant for multiple periods.


### Set-up

Assuming additive treatment effects,

$$
Y_{it} = \begin{cases}
Y_{it}(0) & \text{if } t < t_0 \\
Y_{it}(0) + D_i\cdot(Y_{it}(1)-Y_{it}(0)) & \text{if } t \geq t_0
\end{cases}
$$

$$
= Y_{it}(0) + T_t\cdot D_i\cdot(Y_{it}(1)-Y_{it}(0))
$$

where, - ( $T_t$ ): dummy variable ( $=1$ ) after period of treatment (( $t_0$ ) onwards). - ( $D_i$ ): dummy variable ( $=1$ ) if unit ( $i$ ) is in the treated group, 0 otherwise.


::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Note: ( $(Y_{it}(1),Y_{it}(0))$) depend on time; so,

$$
Y_{it}(1)-Y_{it}(0) \lesseqqgtr Y_{it'}(1)-Y_{it'}(0)
$$
:::

## Exclusion Restrictions

The above set-up implies the following exclusion restrictions,[^paralleltrends-4]

[^paralleltrends-4]: Particularly important in observational studies with group and/or irregular assignment.


::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exclusion restriction: No pre-emptive behaviour

$$
Y_{it}=Y_{it}(0) \quad \forall\; (i,t)\;\text{s.t. }\;t< t_0
$$
::: 


and,

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exclusion restriction: No spillovers

$$
Y_{it}=Y_{it}(0) \quad \forall \;(i,t) \;\text{s.t.}\;D_i=0
$$
:::

and,

::: exampleblock
**Exclusion restriction: No switching**

**Treatment group** status, ( $D_i$ ), does not depend on time. Only treatment status, $D_i \cdot T_t$, varies with time.
:::

## Dynamic Confounding Factors

Let us consider the first (dynamic) difference with just **two periods of data**,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&E[Y_{it}|D_i=1,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}|D_i=1,T_t=0] \\
=&E[Y_{it}(1)|D_i=1,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0] \\
=&\underbrace{E[Y_{it}(1)|D_i=1,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]}_{\text{ATT in period } t_0} \\
&\underbrace{+E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0]}_{\text{(dynamic) confounding factors}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Once again, we don't observe the counterfactual for the treated group. **As such**, the CEF does not trace out a causal relationship.

Notice, however, that for the untreated group,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&E[Y_{it}|D_i=0,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}|D_i=0,T_t=0] \\
=&E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0]
\end{aligned}
$$

which looks very similar to,

$$
E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0]
$$

from the treated group.

::: block
**Parallel Trends Assumption (General version)**

$$
\begin{aligned}
&E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0] \\
=&E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0]
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

With this assumption and the above exclusion restrictions, we have identification of the Average Treatment Effect **of the Treated**.

With this assumption we can identify the ATT,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\big[E[Y_{it}|D_i=1,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}|D_i=1,T_t=0]\big]\\
&-\big[\textcolor{blue}{E[Y_{it}|D_i=0,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}|D_i=0,T_t=0]}\big] \\
=&\big[E[Y_{it}(1)|D_i=1,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0]\big] \\
&-\big[\textcolor{blue}{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0]}\big] \\
=&\big[E[Y_{it}(1)|D_i=1,T_t=1]\textcolor{red}{-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]}\big] \\
&+\big[\textcolor{red}{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]}-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0]\big] \\
&-\big[\textcolor{blue}{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0]}\big] \\
=&\underbrace{\big[E[Y_{it}(1)|D_i=1,T_t=1]\textcolor{red}{-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]}\big]}_{\text{ATT in period } t_0}
\end{aligned}
$$

where the two penultimate lines cancel one another under parallel trends. Hence, the name **difference-in-differences**.

## Mapping to Linear Model

Let's consider the CEF of ( $Y_{it}^{obs}$ ),

$$
E[Y_{it}|D_i,T_t]
$$

where, ( $Y_{it} = Y_{it}(0) + T_t \cdot D_i(Y_{it}(1) - Y_{it}(0))$ ).[^paralleltrends-5]

[^paralleltrends-5]: Remember, this equation implies our exclusion restrictions.

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[Y_{it}|D_i,T_t] &= E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i,T_t] + T_t \cdot D_i E[(Y_{it}(1) - Y_{it}(0))|D_i,T_t] \\
&= E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i,T_t=0] \\
&\quad + T_t \cdot \left( E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i,T_t=1] - E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i,T_t=0] \right) \\
&\quad + T_t \cdot D_i \cdot E[(Y_{it}(1) - Y_{it}(0))|D_i,T_t]
\end{aligned}
$$

**Under parallel trends**,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i,T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i,T_t=0] \\
&= \textcolor{blue}{E[Y_{it}(0)|T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|T_t=0]} \\
&= \textcolor{blue}{\delta}
\end{aligned}
$$

a constant! So, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[Y_{it}|D_i,T_t] &= E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i,T_t=0] \\
&+ T_t \cdot \left( \textcolor{blue}{\underbrace{E[Y_{it}(0)|T_t=1]-E[Y_{it}(0)|T_t=0]}_{\delta}} \right) \\
&+ T_t \cdot D_i \cdot E[(Y_{it}(1)-Y_{it}(0))|D_i,T_t]
\end{aligned}
$$

We can then expand ($E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i, T_t=0]$)

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i,T_t=0] &= E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0] \\
&+ D_i \cdot \left( \textcolor{red}{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0] - E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0]} \right) \\
&= \alpha + \psi D_i
\end{aligned}
$$

where \$\\{\\alpha, \\psi\\}\$ are two more constants. So, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[Y_{it}|D_i,T_t] &= \underbrace{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0]}_{\alpha} \\
&+ D_i \cdot \left( \textcolor{red}{\underbrace{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0] - E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0]}_{\psi}} \right) \\
&+ T_t \cdot \textcolor{blue}{\delta} + T_t \cdot D_i \cdot E[(Y_{it}(1)-Y_{it}(0))|D_i,T_t]
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, we can show,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&T_t \cdot D_i \cdot E[(Y_{it}(1) - Y_{it}(0))|D_i,T_t] \\
&= T_t \cdot D_i \cdot \textcolor{purple}{E[(Y_{it}(1) - Y_{it}(0))|D_i=1,T_t=1]} \\
&= T_t \cdot D_i \cdot \tau_{ATT}(t_0) 
\end{aligned}
$$

If we want, we can assume the ATT is static: ( \tau\*{ATT}(t_0) =\* \tau{ATT} ; \forall ; t ).

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[Y_{it}|D_i,T_t] &= \alpha + \textcolor{red}{\psi}D_i + \textcolor{blue}{\delta}T_t \\
&+ T_t \cdot D_i \cdot \textcolor{purple}{\underbrace{E[(Y_{it}(1) - Y_{it}(0))|D_i=1,T_t=1}_{\tau_{ATT}(t_0)}} \\
&= \alpha + \textcolor{red}{\psi}D_i + \textcolor{blue}{\delta}T_t + \textcolor{purple}{\tau_{ATT}(t_0)} T_t \cdot D_i
\end{aligned}
$$

::: block
**Parallel Trends Assumption (Parametric version)**

$$
E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i,T_t] = \alpha + \psi D_i + \delta T_t
$$
:::

-   Note: assumption concerning the CEF.
-   Note: includes treatment group status.

Thus,

$$
\underbrace{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=1]}_{\alpha + \delta} - \underbrace{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0]}_{\alpha} = \delta
$$

and,

$$
\underbrace{\textcolor{red}{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]}}_{\alpha + \psi + \delta} - \underbrace{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0]}_{\alpha + \psi} = \delta
$$

## DiD and CIA

Do we need the CIA/Unconfoundedness assumption?\
**NO**, Why not?

-   We do not identify the ATT as the coefficient on ( $D_i$ ).

-   With two sources of variation, both time and treatment group, we can identify the selection term in the pre-period,

    $$
    E[Y_i(0)|D_i=1,T_i=0] - E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0,T_i=0] = \psi
    $$

-   Key assumption: selection doesn't change over time; i.e., *parallel/common trends*.

## Selection

Let us consider the first (cross-sectional) difference,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&E[Y_{it}|D_i=1,T_t=1] - E[Y_{it}|D_i=0,T_t=1] \\
&= E[Y_{it}(1)|D_i=1,T_t=1] - E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=1] \\
&= \underbrace{E[Y_{it}(1)|D_i=1,T_t=1] \textcolor{red}{- E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]}}_{\text{ATT in period } t_0} \\
&\quad \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{+ E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]} - E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=1]}_{\text{selection between groups}}
\end{aligned}
$$

which is very similar to,

$$
E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0] - E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0]
$$

from the first period.

## Selection

With the parallel trends assumption,

Selection is given by

$$
\underbrace{\textcolor{red}{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]}}_{\alpha + \psi + \delta} - \underbrace{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=1]}_{\alpha + \delta} = \psi
$$

and

$$
\underbrace{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0]}_{\alpha + \psi} - \underbrace{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0]}_{\alpha} = \psi
$$

-   Permits level differences between treatment and control.
-   Selection term is identified in pre-period.[^paralleltrends-6]

[^paralleltrends-6]: Emphasizes importance of 'no pre-emptive behaviour' assumption.

## Difference-in-differences

Again we can identify the ATT as a *difference-in-differences*,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\left[E[Y_{it}|D_i=1,T_t=1] - \textcolor{blue}{E[Y_{it}|D_i=0,T_t=1]}\right] \\
&- \left[E[Y_{it}|D_i=1,T_t=0] - \textcolor{blue}{E[Y_{it}|D_i=0,T_t=0]}\right] \\
&= \left[E[Y_{it}(1)|D_i=1,T_t=1] - \textcolor{blue}{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=1]}\right] \\
&- \left[E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0] - \textcolor{blue}{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0]}\right] \\
&= \underbrace{\left[E[Y_{it}(1)|D_i=1,T_t=1] \textcolor{red}{- E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]}\right]}_{\tau_{ATT}(t_0)} \\
&+ \underbrace{\left[\textcolor{red}{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1]} - \textcolor{blue}{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=1]}\right]}_{= \psi} \\
&- \underbrace{\left[E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0] - \textcolor{blue}{E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0]}\right]}_{= \psi}
\end{aligned}
$$

-   Parallel trends allow us to pin down the selection component.
-   We do not need unconfoundedness to rule out selection.

## DiD in Practice

### Multi-group-2-period

**In a 'natural' experiment setting**, treatment is almost always assigned at a group-level setting: geographical, demographic, etc.

Let ( $Y_{itc}$ ) be the outcome of unit ( $i$ ) in period ( $t$), member of assignment-group ( $c(i)$ ),

$$
c(i) \in \{1, \ldots, c_0, c_0 + 1, \ldots, C\}
$$

where groups are:

-   Treated: ( $1$, $\ldots, c_0$ ) (no. treated groups = ( $c_0$ ))
-   Control: ( $c_0 + 1$, \ldots, C ) (no. control groups $=$ ( $C - c_0$ ))

Thus,

$$
D_i = D_{c(i)} = \mathbf{1}\{c(i) \leq c_0\}
$$

## Group Assignment

The relevant estimating equation is then,

$$
Y^{obs}_{itc} = \alpha + \psi D_{c} + \delta T_t + \beta D_{c} \cdot T_t + \varepsilon_{itc}
$$

-   A model that can be estimated using repeated cross-sections or panel/longitudinal data.[^paralleltrends-7]

[^paralleltrends-7]: This is also true for unit-level assignment, assuming sample selection of the subsequent cross-sections is independent of treatment.

## Group Fixed Effects

Fixed effects notation is used extensively in Microeconometrics.

Given a set of assignment-groups ( $c = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, C$), assignment-group FE's can be written as,

$$
\psi_c = \sum_{j=1}^{C} \psi_j \mathbf{1}\{c = j\}
$$

-   A dummy variable for each value.
-   Standard to drop the constant term in the regression equation.
-   Implicitly, this is a group-specific constant.

::: block
**Parallel Trends Assumption (parametric version)**

$$
E[Y_{it}(0)|D_c,T_t] = \psi_c + \delta T_t
$$
:::

## Group Fixed Effects

Consider the two estimating equations,

$$
Y^{obs}_{itc} = \alpha + \psi D_c + \delta T_t + \beta_1 D_c \cdot T_t + \varepsilon_{itc}
$$

and

$$
Y^{obs}_{itc} = \psi_c + \delta T_t + \beta_2 D_c \cdot T_t + \epsilon_{itc}
$$

-   (\hat{\beta}\_2 = \hat{\beta}\_1) **IF** group size does not change with time; i.e., a balanced panel of groups with stable group sizes. Group size need not be equal.
-   Does not introduce bias.
-   But, ( se(\hat{\beta}\_2) ) **tends to be** smaller than ( se(\hat{\beta}\_1) )[^paralleltrends-8].

[^paralleltrends-8]: \`tends to be', because you also decrease the degree of freedom.

With group FE's we *typically* explain more of the variation in ( Y(0) ).

## Example: UK Policy

Suppose Scotland and Wales introduce a policy to restrict access to fast food in year ( t_0 ) and you have individual-level measures of BMI from across the UK.

-   ( c(i) \in {1; \\\\\\\\text{\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\`Scotland''}, 2; \\\\\\\\text{\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\`Wales''}, 3; \\\\\\\\text{\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\`England''}, 4; \\\\\\\\text{\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\`Northern Ireland''} } )

-   ( D_c = \mathbf{1}{c \leq 2} )

-   Estimating equations,

    $$
    Y^{obs}_{itc} = \alpha + \psi D_c + \delta T_t + \beta_1 D_c \cdot T_t + \varepsilon_{itc}
    $$

    and

    $$
    Y^{obs}_{itc} = \underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^{4} \psi_j \mathbf{1}\{c = j\}}_{\psi_c} + \delta T_t + \beta_2 D_c \cdot T_t + \epsilon_{itc}
    $$

## Unit Fixed Effects

Suppose, you have **panel/longitudinal data**, then the specification,

$$
Y^{obs}_{itc} = \alpha_i + \delta T_t + \beta_3 D_c\cdot T_t + \upsilon_{itc}
$$

will **typically** yield an even more efficient estimator.

-   $\hat{\beta}_3=\hat{\beta}_2=\hat{\beta}_1$ **IF** all units are observed in all periods; i.e., a balanced panel of units.
-   Does not introduce bias.
-   $se(\hat{\beta}_3)$ **tends to be** smaller than $se(\hat{\beta}_2)$, which *tends to be* smaller than $se(\hat{\beta}_1)$.
-   Increases the power of the test for $H_0: \tau_{ATT}=0$.
-   Higher dimensions of FEs *tend to* yield lower variance estimators.

## Adding Covariates

There are two reasons to add **GOOD** covariates to the model:

1.  Improve the precision of estimates and increase power.
2.  For identification (when *unconditional* parallel trends fail).

**Conditional Parallel Trends Assumption (General version)**

$$
\begin{aligned}
&E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=1,X_i'] - E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=0,T_t=0,X_i'] \\
&= E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=1,X_i'] - E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i=1,T_t=0,X_i']
\end{aligned}
$$

or

**Conditional Parallel Trends Assumption (CEF version)**

$$
E[Y_{it}(0)|D_i,T_t,X_{it}] = \alpha + \psi D_i + \delta T_t + X_{it}'\gamma
$$

## Adding Covariates

-   A *weaker* assumption.
-   In a balanced panel, time-invariant differences across groups are captured by treatment-group dummy (or assignment-group/unit FEs).

**Warning:** \> If estimates are sensitive to the inclusion of good covariates, it suggests that one of the identifying assumptions *may* have failed. **Why is the covariate composition of the groups changes differentially over time?** Could be due to non-parallel trends or switching between groups.

With *only 2 periods* of data, there is no test of the parallel trends assumption.

-   Intuitively, similar groups *may* be more likely to follow parallel trends.
-   Argument for matching on covariates in pre-period. For example, PSM-DID.

## DiD in Practice - Multiple Time Periods

Suppose you had more than 2 periods of data, you might then choose to add time-fixed effects,

$$
Y^{obs}_{itc} = \psi_c + \delta_t + \beta_3 D_c\cdot T_t + \upsilon_{itc}
$$

where $T_t=\mathbf{1}\{t\geq t_0\}$ and $t_0$ is the period of treatment.

-   However, we first need to discuss *dynamic* treatment effects.

**Next lecture.**

## Card & Krueger (1994)

This paper[^paralleltrends-9],

[^paralleltrends-9]: Angrist & Pischke attribute the first use of DiD in Economics to Obenauer & von den Nienburg (1915) (see page 228 of *Mostly Harmless Econometrics*).

-   arguably, established difference-in-difference as the central tool in Applied Microeconomics research;
-   turned the literature on the minimum wage upside down;
-   won David Card the Nobel Prize in Economics;
-   and started the closest thing to a fight in academic Economics.[^paralleltrends-10]

[^paralleltrends-10]: The debate between Card and Krueger (since deceased, 2019), and Neumark and Wascher is ongoing.

## Card & Krueger (1994)

### Pre-1990's Literature

-   Most of the literature supported the idea that higher minimum wages reduce employment.
-   Wellington (1991) & Brown et al. (1983): A 10% increase in minimum wage reduces teen employment by 1%.
-   Largely based on time-series evidence (Brown et al., 1982) or cross-country studies.

> "Isolating the impacts of labor market institutions is inherently difficult... Identification issues essentially result from the endogeneity of labor market institutions and the interactions between them... makes it difficult to attribute variations in outcomes to the institutions themselves, rather than other features of the societies in which they exist." - Baetcherman (2012)

## Card & Krueger (1994)

**Card & Krueger (AER, 1994)** is a seminal paper in this literature[^paralleltrends-11],

[^paralleltrends-11]: And Katz & Krueger (ILR Review, 1992)

-   Increase in New Jersey minimum wage from \$4.25 to \$5.05, April 1992.
-   Examine the impact on employment at fast food outlets (low wage jobs).
-   Use Pennsylvania as a control group in a **DiD research design**.
-   Find **no evidence** of a negative employment effect.

This paper highlights the fact that you can make strong conclusions from what is effectively a very simple research design.

## Legislative Change

This minimum wage change **was not unexpected**:

-   Federal minimum wage is the floor to all state level minimum wages.
-   Federal increase from \$3.35 to \$3.80 in April 1990.
-   Federal increase from \$3.80 to \$4.25 in April 1991.
-   New Jersey chose to increase its own minimum wage to \$5.05 effective April 1992, giving it the highest minimum wage in the country.
-   Opposed by business leaders, but the opposition lost an appeal (March, 1992) by a close margin.

This last-minute appeal and close election do create some uncertainty.

## Research Design

CK (1994) implement a basic difference-in-difference research design

$$
\tau_{ATT} = \big(E[Y_{it}|T_t=1,D_i=1] - E[Y_{it}|T_t=0,D_i=1]\big) - \big(E[Y_{it}|T_t=1,D_i=0] - E[Y_{it}|T_t=0,D_i=0]\big)
$$

where ( T_t = \mathbf{1}{\text{after April 1992}} ), and

$$
D_i = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{New Jersey} \\
0 & \text{Pennsylvania}
\end{cases}
$$

Card & Krueger (1994)}

## Card & Krueger (1994)

Conclusion,

-   No evidence of a negative effect, as competitive models would predict.
-   If anything, some evidence of a small positive effect, as suggested by monopsonistic models.
-   Card & Krueger (1994) don't show pre-trends to help persuade you that the parallel trends assumption is likely to hold.
-   After this paper comes the rebuttal by Neumark & Wascher (2000, AER), followed immediately by a response from Card & Krueger (2000, AER).
-   This is just round 1 of what is a multi-round debate. The discussion has now shifted away from state-level minimum wages to the study of city-specific policies.
