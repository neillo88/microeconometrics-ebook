The concept of directed acyclic graphs, which we will refer to from now on as DAGs, began in the mid 20th century with the development of computer science. As with most of science DAGs came to solve the problem of graphing dependencies among variables. It is important to emphasize for the curious reader the author who has brought DAGs to be part of the causality literature and that man is Judea Pearl.\nHere I present an example to demonstrate what I am talking about:\nTap here to see the code\n# Define the DAG we are going to use dag0 for the first dag, you can use whatever name you like. \n\ndag0 &lt;- dagify(y ~ x)\n\n# This plots the dag\n\nggdag(dag0) + \n  theme_dag() +\n  ggtitle(\"Effect of X on Y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure C.1: Effect of X on Y",

    "text": "E.1 Causality\nDAGs are useful when it comes to drawing causal relationships between variables. If X causes Y but Y does not cause X then we can represent this by the following graph:\n\n\nShow the code\ndag1 &lt;- dagify(\n  Y ~ X,\n  labels = c(X = \"X\", Y = \"Y\")\n)\n\nggdag(dag1) +\n  theme_dag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can have a mediator between X and Y. So, X affects Y through Z.\n\n\nShow the code\ndag2 &lt;- dagify(\n  Y ~ Z,\n  Z ~ X,\n  labels = c(X = \"X\", Z = \"Mediator Z\", Y = \"Y\")\n)\n\nggdag(dag2) + \n  theme_dag() +\n  ggtitle(\"DAG with Mediation: X affects Z, and Z affects Y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA real life example of this \\(X\\) being technological innovation, \\(Z\\) being productivity and \\(Y\\) is Economic growth. Please note that this is just an example and you could find evidence that does not support this simplified version of reality.\nDAGs could also help us to visualise some assumptions we as econometricians make. We could represent confounders in DAGs.\n\nConfounder\n\nIn causal inference a confounder is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and the independent variable causing a spurious association\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ndag3 &lt;- dagify(\n  Y ~ X + M,\n  X ~ M,\n  labels = c(X = \"Education Intervention\", Y = \"Job Performance\", M = \"Motivation Level\"),\n  exposure = \"X\",\n  outcome = \"Y\"\n)\n\nggdag(dag3, text = TRUE) +  \n  theme_dag() +\n  ggtitle(\"DAG: Education Intervention's Effect on Job Performance with Motivation Level as a Confounder\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nadjustedSet &lt;- adjustmentSets(dag3)\nprint(adjustedSet)\n\n\n{ M }",
