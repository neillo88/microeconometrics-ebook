### Def. Finite Population Propensity Score

The propensity score at $x$ is the average unit assignment probability
for units with $X_i = x$ $$
e(x)=\frac{1}{N(x)} \sum_{i=1} p_i(X,Y(0),Y(1))
$$

### Def. Unit Assignment Probability

The probability that unit $i$ is assigned to treatment, $$
p_i(X,Y(0),Y(1)) = \sum_{W:W_i=1}\mathbf{Pr}(W|X,Y(0),Y(1))
$$
:::

In a completely randomized experiment, $$
e(X_i)=\frac{N_t}{N}
$$ i.e. equal for all units and independent of $X_i$
